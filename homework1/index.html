        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>Founded in 2009 by CPA youth leaders, Youth MOJO (Movement of Justice and Organizing) is a leadership development program for high school youth, with a focus on low-income Chinese American youth. Since its founding, Youth MOJO leaders have worked on social issues affecting youth and their families such as healthcare, education, immigrant and workersâ€™ rights. Through Youth MOJO, youth leaders develop and strengthen their leadership, public speaking, communication, advocacy, and organizing skills. Youth MOJO leaders meet weekly during the school year. During the summer, youth participate in the Youth MOJO Summer Program and the Youth Leadership Retreat.</p>
